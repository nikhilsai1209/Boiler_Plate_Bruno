# Bruno API Testing Boilerplate

## About

This repository provides a boilerplate for API testing using [Bruno](https://usebruno.com/), a powerful and lightweight open-source tool for API testing. The project uses open APIs from [ReqRes](https://reqres.in/) and [AirportGap](https://airportgap.com/) for demonstration.

1. **ReqRes**: A hosted REST API for testing and prototyping.
    - Example Endpoint: `/api/users`
    - Use Cases: User creation, listing users.
2. **AirportGap**: A free REST API for accessing airport-related data.
    - Example Endpoint: `/airports`
    - Use Cases: Fetching details about airports.
